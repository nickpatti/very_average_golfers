# very_average_golfers
Blog-style website for the Very Average Golf Society

The first website I built, starting 3 days after I began learning Django. 

The website includes the following features:

- An updatable home page, where the logo, colour scheme for the banner and the content can be edited by the client.
- A blog page under each 'Articles of Association' page.
- A gallery, making use of many to one fields, where the client can add albums, photos and videos.
- A comment section for every photo and video in each album - the client does not have Facebook so I built this myself, rather than using the API.
- Updatable tables - I have included the CKEditor so the client is able to update tables in the 'Roll of Honour' section
- A changelog - I added a changelog of my own volition - I frequently provide updates to the website and this is a good way to check if any bugs make it past unit tests.
- Responsive design - most css values are based off of screen size so the website looks similar on all devices.
- Ability to switch between two different web designs.


A year after creating this website, I went back and rehauled the whole front-end, creating a new base template and a new css. I decided I would give the client the option to switch between which template they wanted to use, as we found it quite funny how much I had grown in just a year. Needless to say they now keep the website with the new look.
